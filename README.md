> **Interactive web application** for predicting employee burnout risk based on professional data, combining a Machine Learning model (logistic regression) with a rule-based scoring system.

---

## 📸 Overview

The user fills out a form with their professional information, and the application instantly returns:
- The **risk level** (low ✅ / moderate ⚠️ / high 🔴 / very high 🚨)
- The **burnout probability** as a percentage

## 🎯 Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **ML Prediction** | Logistic regression model trained on synthetic HR data |
| 📏 **Business Rules** | Scoring system based on stress, hours, satisfaction & remote work |
| ⚖️ **Hybrid Score** | Weighted combination: 30% ML + 70% business rules |
| 🌐 **Web Interface** | Interactive form with instant results |
| 🎨 **Modern Design** | Clean UI with gradients, card shadows & responsive layout |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tool | Usage |
|---|---|
| **Python 3.12** | Core language |
| **Flask** | Web framework (backend + routing) |
| **Scikit-learn** | Model training & `StandardScaler` |
| **Pandas** | Data preprocessing & one-hot encoding |
| **Joblib** | Model serialization (`.pkl`) |

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle — Synthetic HR Burnout Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankam6010/synthetic-hr-burnout-dataset)
- **Target variable**: `Burnout` (0 = No burnout, 1 = Burnout)

### Input Features

## 📈 Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| **Accuracy** | 96.25% |
| **Recall (Burnout)** | 88.46% |
| **Precision (Burnout)** | 65.71% |

---

## 🧮 Hybrid Scoring System

The final prediction combines two approaches:

```
Final Score = (ML × 0.30) + (Business Rules × 0.70)
```

### Business Rules

| Factor | Condition | Points |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Stress | ≥ 8 → +50 · ≥ 6 → +35 · ≥ 4 → +15 | 0–50 |
| ⏰ Hours/week | ≥ 60 → +40 · ≥ 50 → +25 · ≥ 45 → +10 | 0–40 |
| 😞 Satisfaction | ≤ 1.5 → +35 · ≤ 2.5 → +20 · ≤ 3.0 → +10 | 0–35 |
| 🏠 Remote work | < 20% AND stress ≥ 5 → +15 | 0–15 |

### Risk Interpretation

| Probability | Result |
|---|---|
| < 20% | ✅ Low risk |
| 20 – 44% | ⚠️ Moderate risk |
| 45 – 69% | 🔴 High risk |
| ≥ 70% | 🚨 Very high risk |
